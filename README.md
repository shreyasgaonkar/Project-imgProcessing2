# Project-imgProcessing2

MATLAB based project aimed at implementing the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transform for face detection and recognition. 

1. Extract training images from .dat file.
2. Normalized the training images with zero DC value and unit variance.
3. Display average face out of all the training images.
4. Compute co-variance matrix to find Eigen Values and Eigen Vectors.
5. Calculate the difference in training images and average face
6 Calculate the error for each image and print co-ordinates of each image.
7. Verify if all faces detected and recognized.
